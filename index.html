<p><i>By Lisa Thomson</i></p>


<p> New York City is often touted as a city of immigrants. According to 2014 Census estimates, 37 percent of the city's population of 8.5 million is foreign born. At the national level, only 13.1 percent of the total population is foreign born.</p>

			<h4>Nigerians</h4>
			<p>NYC has the largest Nigerian immigrant population in the country. Of the 376,000 Nigerians who live in the US, 20,000 of them make their home here.</p>

			<p>Lookman Mashoud is one of those people. Mashood came to the US in the 90s and in 2010 opened a Nigerian restaurant called Buka in the Fort Greene, Brooklyn. Mashoud says his restaurant is a hub for Nigerians who both live in the city and who are just visiting. He says it's a place where people can be found speaking the lingua frana of Nigeria, Nigerian Pidgin.</p>

			<p>John Adeyeye is a 22 year old computer science student who recently started coming to Buka. Adeyeye was born in Nigeria and moved to the US when he was 8 years old. He says he started coming to the restaurant after Nigerian friends he met at Medgar Evers College suggested it would be a good place to go to learn about Nigerian culture. He said that growing up his parents worked a lot so he didn't get a chance to speak a language other than English but now he's practicing Yoruba, one of the official languages in Nigeria, with his friends.</p>
